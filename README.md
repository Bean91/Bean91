### My name is Ben Kiev
I like building low-level tools and systems in C++ to improve my skills that are focused on open-souce readability and documentation

### I'm currently working on:
 - [**Open Chat**](https://github.com/Bean91/Open-Chat) - a small language model written in C++ from scratch
 - [**Open Alert**](https://github.com/Bean91/Open-Alert) - a school safety device for Connecticut Science and Engineering Fair
 - [**OpeNoted**](https://openoted.com) - my simple portfolio website

### My finished (version 1 for most) projects:
 - [**Open Render**](https://github.com/Bean91/Open-Render) - a single-header C++ 3D rendering engine that outputs raw RGBA
 - [**Open Encrypt**](https://github.com/Bean91/Open-Encrypt) - simple traditional cipher demos, (to be revamped)
 - [**Stew and Ben Inc.**](https://github.com/StewandBenInc/StewandBeninc) - a website I made with a friend

### My languages
 - Intermediate-Advanced C++
 - Intermediate Python
 - Intermediate Java
 - Intermediate ReactJS/Tailwind-CSS
 - Intermediate HTML/JS/CSS

### What I'm learning
 - How LLM's work
 - Raw binary file writing in C++

### Contributing
I'm very open to contribution on my projects (except for Open Chat until May as it is a school project).
Feel free to open a pull request, but make sure to write human readable code. **Everything is open source, so make sure you are okay with that before opening a PR.**
